# 0Wikipedia

This is a Google Chrome extension for accessing Wikipedia's mirror (0Wikipedia.org, wiki-zero) without adding 0 to the link
manually. 

It is mostly useful for the countries that Wikipedia blocked. With this extension it is not necessary to add 0 to the link to 
reach Wikipedia's mirror manually. It will do that for you automatically.

# How to install it?

You can go to Chrome Web Store and search "0Wikipedia" or you can download this repository and upload it to your browser
manually by clicking "Customize and control Google Chrome" > "More tools" > "Extensions".
