# 0Wikipedia

This is a Google Chrome extension for accessing Wikipedia's mirror (0Wikipedia.org, wiki-zero) without adding 0 to the link
manually. 

It is mostly useful for the countries that Wikipedia blocked. With this extension it is not necessary to add 0 to the link to 
reach Wikipedia's mirror manually. It will do that for you automatically.

# How to install it?

You can go to Chrome Web Store and search "0Wikipedia" or go to this link: "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/0wikipedia/khomacefeomcipbnbjlkanejinoodbgk" or you can download this repository and upload it to your browser
manually by clicking "Customize and control Google Chrome" > "More tools" > "Extensions".
